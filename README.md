# Real-Time Voice Cloning

This fork is for anyone who had trouble getting Corentin Jemine's original [project](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning) up and running. Maybe you don't have a GPU machine. Maybe your CUDA drivers aren't configured. Or maybe one of a dozen other things went wrong.

To solve this, we can clone voices in the cloud using Amazon SageMaker. We won't implement the toolbox so there are no fancy visualizations and there is no GUI. But you will be able to get the functionality of `demo_cli.py` with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account. We will be using resources that aren't available with free tier, i.e. P2 instances.
* A python installation with boto3.
* TBD...

## Instructions
